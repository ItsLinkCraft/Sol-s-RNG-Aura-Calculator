I'm mostly just adding this to get rid of an annoying window in GitHub, but I will add a few notes here.  

First, this uses a decimal system, so if you're trying to roll something like lets say Natural, you would have to convert it from 1/8 to 0.125 on your end. 
[Later on I will attempt to make it a fraction system.]
Also, if the sum of everything is 1, it means that you can't roll that aura, because you roll higher than it.

If there is any problems with this program, DM me on discord, my username is ItsLinkCraft
